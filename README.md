# BlindSpot-ChatApp

Chat Interface for Blind is a software tool that can be use by a normal
person to chat with a blind-deaf person. This application can be broken down to
two main parts. The fist is taking input and showing the output to the normal
person. The second is taking input from the blind person and performing dynamic
braille operation so that the blind deaf person can sense the output.

The model we propose is a DIY dynamic braille that anyone with basic
Arduino programming can attempt. This system can also be extended by
developers by adding chat interfaces and integrating with text editors and
web browsers so that visually impaired users can attempt at reading text
from digital devices and use braille embedded keyboards to access the
computers.

To solve the problems of braille system, we need refresher display. This
would eliminate the need of printing technologies and hence, eliminate the
disadvantages related to it. The dynamic braille must be able to match
the userâ€™s speed of reading. So it its refresh rate must be calibrated
according to each user and his/her specific needs.

The development to low cost, efficient, refreshable displays for Braille text would give Braille
readers access to all kinds of digital technology and enormous volume of
information on the internet, opening doors for educational, employment
and recreational opportunities. This technology would opens a new area
for developers to create interactive features and applications and this
could evolve into a new full-scale industry. A dynamic braille can be a
portable tool for visually impaired people to communicate with other
visually impaired people as well as non-disabled persons.
