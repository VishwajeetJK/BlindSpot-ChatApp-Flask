# BlindSpot-ChatApp-Flask

Chat Interface for Blind Deaf is a software tool that can be use by a normal
person to chat with a blind-deaf person. This application can be broken down to
two main parts. The fist is taking input and showing the output to the normal
person. The second is taking input from the blind person and performing dynamic
braille operation so that the blind deaf person can sense the output.

The application would also require providing the normal persons to give
their details to the guardian of the blind deaf and then be authorized to chat
through this software. This software requires the person to register or login if he
is a member and then select the Bluetooth device to connect to. Then the
software directs the person to the chatting page.

The blind deaf side of the software will enable the individual to connect the
interface to a dynamic braille system built using motors and Arduino Uno. This
system enables the person to interpret the chat received. Replies can be made
using the keyboard containing braille characters
